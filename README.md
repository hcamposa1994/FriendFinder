# Friend Finder

#### What is this app doing and why?
The goal of this app is to use both NodeJs and Express to create a basic compatibility app that takes your responses based on a survey of 10 questions and matches you to your best match.

#### How is the app organized?
After the initial start up screen, you are presented with a survey that takes your name, a link to a profile picture, and ten questions where you may put a response from 1-5 based on the question. All fields need to be filled otherwise the app will disallow you to continue

### How to run this app
First you'll be needing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/); aside from that all necessary packages are in the package.json so just run the following command:
```
cd FriendFinder
npm i
node server.js
```
